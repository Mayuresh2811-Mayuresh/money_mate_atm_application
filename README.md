# ATM Management System using C++

ATMs (Automated Teller Machines) are indispensable in modern banking, providing users with convenient access to various financial services such as cash withdrawals, deposits, and balance inquiries. This project aims to simulate the functionality of an ATM through a C++ program, offering users a menu-driven interface for executing transactions.

## Features
- Enter Name, Account number, and Account type for transaction identification.
- Display user information during transactions.
- Deposit funds into the account.
- Display current account balance.
- Withdraw funds from the account.
- Ability to cancel transactions.

## Approach
This program is developed using fundamental concepts of C++ programming, including classes, access modifiers, data types, variables, and switch-case statements. The core functionalities of the program are implemented through the following methods:

- `setvalue()`: Sets user data using basic input/output operations (`cout` and `cin`).
- `showvalue()`: Displays user information.
- `deposit()`: Allows users to deposit money into their accounts.
- `showbal()`: Displays the total account balance after deposits.
- `withdrawl()`: Enables users to withdraw money from their accounts.
- `main()`: Houses the main execution logic, utilizing a switch-case structure within an infinite loop to facilitate user interaction and menu selection.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler.
3. Execute the compiled program.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to navigate through the ATM functionalities and perform transactions.
